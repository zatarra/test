## Notes
- subresource integrity added to safely load 3rd party dependencies
- Standard ESLint check passed: https://eslint.org/demo 
- It was assumed that the initial part was not meant to be changed. Only the calculation part and report features should added to it.
- Instead of reading the team everytime the score is calculated we could just save it as part of the initialization process.
